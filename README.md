# AI-Smart-Email-Classifier

📧 AI-Powered Smart Email Classifier

An end-to-end Machine Learning & NLP project that automatically classifies emails by category and urgency, and provides an interactive dashboard for real-time analysis and deployment.

🚀 Project Overview

Managing large volumes of emails manually is inefficient.
This project solves that problem by using Machine Learning and Transformer models to:

Classify emails into meaningful categories (Spam / Not Spam)

Predict urgency levels (Low / Medium / High)

Provide a web-based dashboard for prediction and visualization

Deploy the solution as a real-world application
